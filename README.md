# Thyroid Cancer Data Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for analyzing thyroid cancer data. It provides basic tools for cleaning data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating visualizations to understand trends and patterns in thyroid cancer datasets.

## Features
- Data cleaning scripts to handle missing values and inconsistencies in the data.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from thyroid cancer datasets.
- Visualization tools to generate plots and charts for easy data interpretation.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
